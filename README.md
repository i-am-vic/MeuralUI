# MeuralUI
Working prototype Windows UI for Meural Canvas

Depends on the unofficial Meural Canvas API.  
    Not a supported interface soooooo .... user beware!

Near the top of the FrameIt.ps1 file are 2 variables for the ID and password
used to access the target Netgear Meural user account.  Set these to the 
prefered values.  

OR leave them asis and enter the correct ID and password values at the 
prompt that will happen.



FUTURE todos for some day in the future:

    Make User ID and password handling more secure.
    Break FrameIt.ps1 into smaller parts.
    Optimize performance.
        Upload of photos could possibly be threaded.
        Dialog management could possibly be improved to reduce flicker.
